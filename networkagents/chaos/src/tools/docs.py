def getFailureAnalysis() -> str:
    """
    Retrieve the GNN failure analysis documentation from Gitea.

    This document describes all fault injection scenarios for the telco-lab
    L3VPN network, including:
    - The fault type, target router/interface, and what changes in the network
    - Which traffic flows are affected and how
    - The GNN detection approach and which GNN node features each fault exercises
    - The GNN value rating (only GNN can detect / GNN improves on traditional /
      GNN reduces alarm noise)
    - Comparison with traditional fault management tools

    Call this tool when the user asks:
    - "Which fault should I inject?" or "What test should I run?"
    - "What does fault N do?" or "Tell me about the MTU mismatch test"
    - "Which faults exercise the OSPF features?" or "What tests the tx_queue_len feature?"
    - "What is the network impact of injecting X?"
    - "Which faults are silent / undetectable by traditional tools?"

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        str: The full failure analysis document as a markdown string, or an
             error message if the document could not be retrieved.
